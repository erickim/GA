# Stat 243 Final Project: Genetic Algorithms Project Spec

(1) Create a package for variable selection in regression problems (including linear regression `lm()` and GLM's `glm()` - optionally `glmnet()`?) using `AIC` as the primary objective/fitness function (but allowing for user implemented fitness functions).

(2,3) The package should be properly modularized and vectorized. Optionally, itcan allow for parallelization.

(4,5,6) Provide documentation and a vignette with example code in a `select.Rd` file which also be generated by the `roxygen2` package. Also provide unit tests using the `testthat` package.

(7) The final solution should have (a) the package generated using `R CMD build GA` or `devtools::create` and (b) a separate PDF vignette describing the solution, the process, and credit (hard copy to turn in).

(8,9,10) Functions for model fitting and those in base R / base installation packages do not need to be reimplemented. Use Git for version control. Make use of partner programming.
